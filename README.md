# Pymaceuticals, Inc

## Background
Pymaceuticals, Inc., is a new pharmaceutical company that specializes in anti-cancer medications. Recently, it began screening for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer.

As a senior data analyst at the company, you've been given access to the complete data from their most recent animal study. In this study, 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumors received treatment with a range of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticalsâ€™ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.

The executive team has tasked you with generating all of the tables and figures needed for the technical report of the clinical study. They have also asked you for a top-level summary of the study results.

## Process
1. Prepare and clean data
2. Generate summary statistics
3. Generate Bar and Pie charts
3. Calculate quartiles, identify outliers, create box plot
4. Generate scatter plot and line plot focusing on Capomulin treatment
5. Calcuate correlation coefficient

## Observations and Insights
* One (1) mouse had its data removed from the dataset, as there were duplicate Timepoints for the mouse (Mouse ID G989)
* Bar graph shows that Capomulin was the drug most mice were treated with (230), followed by Ramicane (228)
* Gender of mice was nearly equally distributed, 125 male vs. 123 female
* Randomly selected mouse treated with Capomulin (Mouse ID M601)shows positive results in that total volume declined over the period of the study
* The correlation between mouse weight and tumor volume for mice treated with Capomulin is positive. As a mouse's weight increases, so does the average tumor volume
* Overall the performance of the drug, Capomulin, was satisfactory within the mice tested
